    Dinnerlove ü•ë is a simple and easy way to plan your meals for a week, keep track of your favourite meals, and come up with new meal ideas.
    Anyone can shuffle through a weeks worth of meals which are displayed at random from the ever growing database. However, for the full experience you should make an account and log in. All that‚Äôs required is your email address and a password, we won‚Äôt ask for any personal information, drop cookies on you or do any other nonsense your used too.
    Joining Dinnerlove lets you add new meals, favourite meals, and save two weeks worth of meal plans (this week and next week).
    </p>
    <p class="info">
      There are three major components to DinnerLove:
      <ol>
        <li class="list">View and love meals: click ‚Äúfind love‚Äù and browse the ever growing selection of yummy goodness. </li>
        <li class="list">Plan meals: DinnerLove lets you plan up to two weeks of meals (this week and next week).  When you have signed in you can shuffle meals, to get a good selection, once you have a week you are happy with hit ‚ÄúPlan this week‚Äù or ‚ÄúPlan next week‚Äù and your plan will be saved.  From that point on when you go to the Dinner Love home page you will be shown your meals for the week.  If you have planned two weeks you can toggle by selecting the the specific week. </li>
        <li class="list">Add Dinner: if you have a favourite meal that‚Äôs not on DinnerLove do everyone a favour and add it, add a nice photo and some notes (a recipe, link to a recipe or just hot tips; this isn‚Äôt a recipe site those are a dime a dozen but point people in the right direction. </li>
      </ol>
     </p>

  <h3 class="info">Unlock the power!</h3>
  <p class="info">
    Lets be honest, Dinnerlove is pretty simple but there are a few things you can do to maximize your experience. In the future I hope to add some functionality to enable users to sort dinners by specific tags; Italian, vegetarian, 10 minutes, that sort of thing.  At the moment that doesn‚Äôt exist; however if you have dietary restrictions or just like some foods better then others you can always go here to view all dinners.  Sort though that list ‚Äúloving‚Äù (click the heart icon) your favourite dishes.  Go into your settings and select the option ‚ÄúOnly show meals you have loved?‚Äù.  You‚Äôll only only see meals you have loved (so be sure to love a lot).

  <p class="info">
    Dinnerlove is a project of Travis Fantina, built mostly for my wife and my own laziness in choosing/remembering meals.  All content on this site (except for the dinners) was created by me (Travis) with the exception of the default dinner image which was created by Katerina Limpitsouni, check out her illustrations at <a href="https://undraw.co">undraw.co</a>.
